    - Removed need to binmode filehandle in get_between() and get_last()
      functions by using sysseek and sysread to avoid unwanted line ending
      conversions.
    - Changed system dependent record separator to a heuristic that should
      DWIM most of the time. Can always be over ridden.

    - Code clean up
    - Documentation clean up
    - Sample scripts added
    - Added META.yml, t/pod.t t/pod_coverage.t to keep Kwalitee happy

0.015 Mon June 2 2008
    - Made pod.t pod_coverage.t kwalitee.t spelling.t test private so
      they only run is RELEASE_TESTING environment var is set - the pod
      tests have been causing spurious test failures.
    - Hacked my Extutils::MM_Any.pm to write a "proper" META.yml
    - Added support for all common logfile date string formats by default
