File::SortedSeek version 0.01
=======================

NAME

File::SortedSeek -  A Perl module providing fast data access to very large files

INSTALLATION

To install this module type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

If you insist on doing a cut an paste install you will need
to install the following file in a location like this:

usr/lib/perl5/site_perl/5.6.0/File/SortedSeek.pm

On Win32 you will probably need to substitute something like
C:\Perl\site\lib\  for  usr/lib/perl5/site_perl/5.6.0/

Before installing any perl module on Win32 I recommend deactivating Norton Antivirus
which conflicts with a lot of stuff, not just Perl and MakeMaker. If your system hangs
when you try to install modules this is a probable cause.

Then just:

    perl Makefile.PL
    nmake
    nmake test
    nmake install

You can get a copy of nmake.exe from Microsoft at <http://download.microsoft.com/download/vc15/Patch/1.52/W95/EN-US/Nmake15.exe>

DEPENDENCIES

Nothing outside standard distribution. Specifically:

Time::Local for logfile munging on date
